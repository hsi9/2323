1. rmse (root mean square error) corresponds approximately to the std
2. Estimators predict a value based on the observed data
3. Using Sklearn fit() method to find the coefficient of all features in linear regression
4. Residual = Observed value - Predicted value   Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in the data in regression analysis
