1. rmse (root mean square error) corresponds approximately to the std
2. Estimators predict a value based on the observed data
3. Using Sklearn fit() method to find the coefficient of all features in linear regression
4. Residual = Observed value - Predicted value   Residual plots are a good way to visualize the errors in the data in regression analysis
5. Pandas has a method of getting dummy variables to do with categorical variables
6. seaborn to visualize data such as sns.pairplot, sns.factorplot
7. to split training data set and testing data set, using train_test_split from sklearn.cross_validation
8. SVM do not directly provide probability estimates
